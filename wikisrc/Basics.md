**Quick Tip:** You can access all the features of the upper menu by right clicking on the background!

1. The `File` menu:
    - This menu currently holds a `Quit` command as well as layout saving and loading options. These layout configs are stored within `.sssb` files, which can be created or loaded by the program itself.

2. The `Add Window` menu:
